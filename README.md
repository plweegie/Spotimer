# Spotimer #

This app communicates with the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) using the [Authorization API for Android](https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk). Search for your favorite song to set a timer to its duration, with a beating animation to boot!

Just build the app and install it on your phone. **Minimum API level 19 (KitKat)**. You will also need to create a Spotify account if you don't have one. Play Store version coming soon.
